# M1_Type Conversion
Done by the compiler on its own, without any external trigger from the user.
Generally takes place when in an expression more than one data type is present. In such condition type conversion (type promotion) takes place to avoid loss of data.
All the data types of the variables are upgraded to the data type of the variable with largest data
